# State Management & Architecture

-> flutter_bloc: BLoC pattern for managing state.
-> equatable: Helps compare objects efficiently.
-> freezed_annotation: Code generation for immutable objects and unions.

# Networking
dio: For making API requests.
retrofit: Helps in API communication with type safety.
retrofit_generator: Generates API-related boilerplate code.

# Dependency Injection
get_it: A service locator for managing dependencies.

# Navigation
go_router: A declarative, simple, and scalable way to handle navigation in Flutter.

# Local Storage
hive_flutter: Used to store authentication tokens securely.
